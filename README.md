## Overview

This project is an implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game using JavaScript and p5.js library. What sets it apart is the use of NEAT, a genetic algorithm, to train the birds in playing the game and improving their performance over generations.

## Features

- **Flappy Bird Gameplay:** Classic Flappy Bird gameplay with a bird that jumps to avoid pipes.
- **NEAT Algorithm:** The NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm is used to evolve the neural networks controlling the bird's actions over generations.
- **p5.js:** The game is built using the p5.js library for easy canvas drawing and interaction.

## Getting Started


### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kaserollinss/Flappy-NEAT/
   
2. Open index.html in a web browser to start the game.
  
3. Watch as the NEAT algorithm trains the birds to improve their performance.

### NEAT Algorithm

The NEAT algorithm works by evolving a population of neural networks. Each bird in the game represents an individual neural network. Over generations, the algorithm mutates and evolves these networks to achieve better results in playing the game.
